The old wizard found the book of all the evil in the world, he was not able to handle all that power, so the book made him obsessed and paranoic. One day, trying to protect it, he did a special and antique magic from the book. He was not powerful enough, so he created a Space-Time loop. Only the knowledge contained in the good books can save him. Can you collect them all?
